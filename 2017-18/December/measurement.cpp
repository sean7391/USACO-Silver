/*
We can use maps to keep track of the frequency of cow measurement, and the 
measurement for each cow. If a cow in question wasn't at the top but is at the 
top now, then the display obviously has to be changed. 

If the cow was already at the top, and is no longer at the top, then the display
has to be changed. 

If the cow was already at the top, and there was at least one other cow at the top
with it, then the display has to be changed.

If the cow was already at the top, and there are currently more than one cow at the top,
then the display has to be changed.
